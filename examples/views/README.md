See https://guide.couchdb.org/draft/views.html for more information about views

From the official CouchDB guide:

- Filtering the documents in your database to find those relevant to a particular process.
- Extracting data from your documents and presenting it in a specific order.
- Building efficient indexes to find documents by any value or structure that resides in them.
- Use these indexes to represent relationships among documents.
- Finally, with views you can make all sorts of calculations on the data in your documents. For example, if documents represent your companyâ€™s financial transactions, a view can answer \* the question of what the spending was in the last week, month, or year.
